# System-programing-project

This project was given by our teacher in the system programming lecture in Sakarya University

In this project, you are expected to develop a transfer program
that creates an output file based on the contents and commands
read from the input file, using the libfdr library in C language. The
project should be built using the fields and dllist structures in the
libfdr program.

● The name of the input and output file (as input.txt and output.txt)
must be given from the command line.

● The characters to be transferred to the output file will be taken
from the input file to the dlllist and the relevant characters will be written
to the output file in the number of numbers determined in
the input file, and the file will be created and saved in the relevant
directory.

● Incorrect situaons that may occur during the execuon of the
program (not entering appropriate parameters, incorrect data in
the input file, format problems, etc.) should be checked and a
warning message should be given to the user.

●  The program should be developed dynamically so that it can
operate in different dimensions.

● At the end of the program, all structures used should be cleaned
and the program should be exited cleanly
